# bingo
Use the objectives.py plain-text style file to define the objectives in one place.

The gen_all_combinations.py script can be run by the python interpreter and will
generate all combinations of difficulty, and split them by whether only pre-drangleic
tasks are defined.

The generated lists are saved to /bingolists.

At some point I *could* update the scripts with extra code to try to avoid potential
collisions.
